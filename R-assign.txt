
Procedural generation in game design uses algorithms to create game content like environments, levels, characters, or items instead of manual design. 
It offers diverse experiences for players by generating content dynamically at runtime. This approach saves time, creates 
vast game worlds, and provides unique gameplay. Examples include generating terrains, creating randomized levels or dungeons, determining item 
properties, and generating diverse non-player characters. Procedural generation is a powerful tool but should be 
balanced with handcrafted content for a satisfying gameplay experience.
